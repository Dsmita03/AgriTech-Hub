        content:
            "Soil pH plays a critical role in determining the availability of essential nutrients for plant growth. It is a measure of the soilâ€™s acidity or alkalinity, ranging from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Most crops thrive in a slightly acidic to neutral pH range of 6.0 to 7.5, as this allows optimal nutrient absorption. When soil becomes too acidic (pH below 6), vital nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium become less available, leading to stunted growth and poor yields. Acidic soils may also accumulate toxic levels of aluminum and manganese, harming plant roots. On the other hand, alkaline soils (pH above 7.5) can cause deficiencies in micronutrients like iron, zinc, and manganese, leading to chlorosis and weak plant development. Farmers regularly test soil pH to determine whether they need to make adjustments. Lime is commonly added to acidic soils to raise pH, while sulfur or organic matter like pine needles can lower pH in overly alkaline soils. Maintaining the correct pH balance not only supports plant health but also enhances microbial activity, which helps decompose organic matter and release nutrients. Sustainable soil management practices such as crop rotation, composting, and organic fertilization help maintain a stable pH, ensuring long-term soil fertility and productivity.",
